# 🧪 Breaking Bad Quotes App

A SwiftUI app that fetches random quotes and details from the **Breaking Bad universe** — including *Breaking Bad*, *Better Call Saul*, and *El Camino*.  

This project demonstrates networking, decoding, and UI handling in Swift using **modern SwiftUI and async/await concurrency**.
In this project I have dealt with many unusual outcomes of data fetching as the API is unofficial, however everything works fine!
